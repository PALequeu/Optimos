# Optimos

Optimos is a Proof-Of-Concept app made as a collaboration between DepInfoNancy (Mines Nancy Computer Science departement), 
ENSAIA (aggro-food industry engineering school) and LORCA (Lorraine farming cooperative). It aims at providing local farmers 
with an evaluation of the rendering of their farming lands, and advise them on how to manage them, including fallow periods,
fertilizer usage and plants to grow.

The front-end app is made with React Native, sharing information with the back-end handle by a firestore database.
